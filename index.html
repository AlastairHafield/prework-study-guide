        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The <body> element is an example of a semantic HTML element.</li>
          <li>Parent/Child style language</li>
          <li>Headings are numbered from H1-H6 and should be used in order</li>
          <li>The < p> element represents a paragraph or block of text.</li>
          <li>The < ul>, < ol>, and < li> elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items.</li>
          <li>The < br> element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content.</li>
          <li>The < img> element contains information about images that are displayed on the webpage. </li>
          <li>The < a> element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages. The href attribute points to the URL for the link</li>
          <li>The < footer> appears at the bottom of the page and usually contains the author, copyright, contact, sitemap, and navigation.</li>
          <li>Some elements are non-semantic e.g  < div> to create a division in the page, or < span> to create an inline division. </li>

        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>We used HTML elements such as < header >, < footer>, and < h1> as selectors in the external style sheet and then applied CSS properties to style them.</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector.</li>
          <li>There are three ways to style a webpage using CSS: inline CSS, internal CSS style sheet, and external CSS style sheet.</li>
          <li>Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only.</li>
          <li>internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
          <li>When using an external style sheet, we link the file using a < link> element placed in the HTML's < head >< /head></li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
          <li>It is important to know that every HTML element is essentially a box, this is sometimes referred to as the CSS box model.</li>
